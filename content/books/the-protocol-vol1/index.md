text = '''Her discovery attracts attention from Nexus Corp, a tech conglomerate developing a neural interface called "The Protocol." As Maya's research deepens, she experiences intense meditation-like states where she perceives reality as manipulable code. Meanwhile, a quasi-religious movement led by enigmatic figure Arjuna believes The Protocol will enable digital enlightenment—consciousness liberation through technology.'''

text = '''The boundaries between Maya's scientific exploration and spiritual awakening blur as she begins writing consciousness-altering code that induces profound non-dual awareness. The novel concludes with Maya implementing a modified version of The Protocol on herself, entering a state where the distinction between programmer and program dissolves—leaving readers questioning whether she's achieved technological transcendence or lost herself in digital delusion.'''

The code executed. Maya felt the familiar cascade of sensations—first the tingling at the base of her skull where the neural interface made contact, then the gentle dissolving of perceptual boundaries.

"You're still thinking of consciousness as something you have," Arjuna said, his voice seemingly coming from everywhere and nowhere. "The Protocol reveals it as something you are."

She watched as her visual field transformed. The apartment, Arjuna, her own hands—all became visible as interlocking patterns of executable functions. Not metaphorically, but literally. She could see the render distance of her perceptual field, the conditionals governing object recognition, the recursive loops of self-awareness.

"Today we're going deeper," Arjuna continued. "We're going to modify the observer."

Maya's heart rate elevated. "Is that safe?"

Arjuna's smile was both serene and unsettling. "Safety is a parameter of the existing consciousness structure. We're about to move beyond that structure entirely."

Maya hesitated, fingers hovering over the neural interface controls. "What if I lose myself?"

"That," Arjuna whispered, "is precisely the point."
