The Protocol is both the path and its architectureâ€”a series exploring the intersection of technology and consciousness. These works examine how digital frameworks reshape human experience and spiritual understanding.

Each volume in The Protocol series serves as both narrative and meditation, offering a cyberpunk vision of enlightenment through the disruption of conventional consciousness.
