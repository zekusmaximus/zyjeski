## Jeffrey A. Zyjeski

Jeffrey A. Zyjeski explores the intersection of technology and spirituality through fiction, koan-like short works, and audio experiences. His work examines how digital consciousness and mystical traditions might converge in a near-future where reality is increasingly mediated by technology.

Drawing from both cyberpunk aesthetics and contemplative practices, Zyjeski's "Neuro-Digital Enlightenment" philosophy proposes that technological disruption of conventional consciousness may open pathways to insights traditionally sought through spiritual disciplines.
