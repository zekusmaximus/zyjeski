Digital-age koans that dissolve the boundaries between machine and consciousness. These brief textual paradoxes are designed to short-circuit dualistic thinking and create momentary glitches in conventional perception.

Each koan exists in a quantum state—simultaneously code and poetry, logic and intuition—until the observer's consciousness collapses its potentiality into meaning.
